However, you can use the Windows Server base OS container image that comes with Windows Server 2022 release: [windows/server](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-server). \r\n\r\n\r\n# About This Image\r\nThis is a base image for Windows Server containers. This image carries the Windows base OS image\r\n\r\nFor more information about servicing lifecycles, visit [Base Image Servicing Lifecycles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/base-image-lifecycle).\r\n\r\n# How to Use this Image\r\nWindows requires the host OS version to match the container OS version. If you want to run a container based on a newer Windows build, make sure you have an equivalent host build. Otherwise, you can use Hyper-V isolation to run older containers on new host builds. You can read more on Windows Container Version Compatibility in our [Container Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility).\r\n\r\nThe default entrypoint is for this image is Cmd.exe. To run the image:\r\n\r\n`docker run mcr.microsoft.com/windows:ltsc2019`\r\n\r\n**Note: This repo does not publish or maintain a** `latest` **tag. Please declare a specific tag when pulling or referencing images from this repo.**\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\n- Your host must have the Windows container feature enabled. The Windows container feature is only available on Windows Server 2016 (Core and with Desktop Experience), Windows 10 Professional and Enterprise (Anniversary Edition) and later.\r\n- If you intend to run the container with Hyper-V isolation, The Hyper-V role must be installed on the host first.\r\n\r\n# Related Repos\r\n+ [windows/nanoserver](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-nanoserver): Nano Server base OS container image\r\n+ [windows/servercore](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore): Windows Server Core base OS container image\r\n+ [windows/server](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-server): Server base OS container image\r\n+ [windows/insider](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-insider/): Insider version of this base OS image.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Full Tag Listing\r\n### Windows Images\nTags | Architecture | Dockerfile | OsVersion | CreatedTime | LastUpdatedTime\n---------| --------------| -----------| -------------| -------------| -------------\n20H2 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19042.1889 | 11/10/2020 | 08/09/2022\n20H2-KB5016616 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19042.1889 | 08/09/2022 | 08/09/2022\n10.0.19042.1889 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19042.1889 | 08/09/2022 | 08/09/2022\n20H2-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19042.1889 | 11/10/2020 | 08/09/2022\n20H2-KB5016616-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19042.1889 | 08/09/2022 | 08/09/2022\n10.0.19042.1889-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19042.1889 | 08/09/2022 | 08/09/2022\n2004 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19041.1415 | 05/27/2020 | 12/14/2021\n2004-KB5008212 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19041.1415 | 12/14/2021 | 12/14/2021\n10.0.19041.1415 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19041.1415 | 12/14/2021 | 12/14/2021\n2004-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19041.1415 | 05/27/2020 | 12/14/2021\n2004-KB5008212-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19041.1415 | 12/14/2021 | 12/14/2021\n10.0.19041.1415-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.19041.1415 | 12/14/2021 | 12/14/2021\n1909 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.18363.1556 | 11/12/2019 | 05/11/2021\n1909-KB5003169 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.18363.1556 | 05/11/2021 | 05/11/2021\n10.0.18363.1556 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.18363.1556 | 05/11/2021 | 05/11/2021\n1909-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.18363.1556 | 11/12/2019 | 05/11/2021\n1909-KB5003169-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.18363.1556 | 05/11/2021 | 05/11/2021\n10.0.18363.1556-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.18363.1556 | 05/11/2021 | 05/11/2021\n1809 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.17763.4010 | 11/13/2018 | 02/14/2023\n1809-KB5022840 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.17763.4010 | 02/14/2023 | 02/14/2023\n10.0.17763.4010 | multiarch | No Dockerfile | 10.0.17763.4010 | 02/14/2023 | 02/14/2023\n1809-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.17763.4010 | 04/05/2019 | 02/14/2023\n1809-KB5022840-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.17763.4010 | 02/14/2023 | 02/14/2023\n10.0.17763.4010-amd64 | amd64 | No Dockerfile | 10.0.17763.4010 | 02/14/2023 | 02/14/2023\n\n### Multi-arch Images\nTags | Achitecture | OS | OsVersion | CreatedTime | LastUpdated Time\n---------| -------------| -------------| ------------| -------------| -------------\n20H2 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.19042.1889 | 11/10/2020 | 08/09/2022\n20H2-KB5016616 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.19042.1889 | 08/09/2022 | 08/09/2022\n10.0.19042.1889 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.19042.1889 | 08/09/2022 | 08/09/2022\n2004 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.19041.1415 | 05/27/2020 | 12/14/2021\n2004-KB5008212 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.19041.1415 | 12/14/2021 | 12/14/2021\n10.0.19041.1415 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.19041.1415 | 12/14/2021 | 12/14/2021\n1909 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.18363.1556 | 11/12/2019 | 05/11/2021\n1909-KB5003169 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.18363.1556 | 05/11/2021 | 05/11/2021\n10.0.18363.1556 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.18363.1556 | 05/11/2021 | 05/11/2021\n1809 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.17763.4010 | 11/13/2018 | 02/14/2023\n1809-KB5022840 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.17763.4010 | 02/14/2023 | 02/14/2023\n10.0.17763.4010 | multiarch | windows | 10.0.17763.4010 | 02/14/2023 | 02/14/2023\n\nYou can retrieve a list of all available tags for windows at https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/windows/tags/list\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nFor support or general questions and feedack, please post in our [GitHub community](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/issues).\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n- Legal Notice: [Container License Information](https://aka.ms/mcr/osslegalnotice)\r\n\r\n**MICROSOFT SOFTWARE SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE FOR WINDOWS CONTAINER BASE IMAGE**\u003cbr/\u003e\r\nThis Supplemental License is for the Windows Container Base Image (“Container Image”).  If you comply with the terms of this Supplemental License you may use the Container Image as described below.\r\n\r\n**CONTAINER OS IMAGE**\u003cbr/\u003e\r\nThe Container Image may only be used with a validly licensed copy of:\r\n* Windows Server Standard or Windows Server Datacenter software (collectively “Server Host Software”), or\r\n* Microsoft Windows Operating System (version 10) software (“Client Host Software”), or\r\n* Windows 10 IoT Enterprise and Windows 10 IoT Core (collectively “IoT Host Software”).\r\n\r\nThe Server Host Software, Client Host Software, and IoT Host Software are collectively referred to as the “Host Software” and a license for Host Software is a \"Host License\".\r\n\r\nYou may not use the Container Image if you do not have a corresponding version and edition of the Host License.  Certain restrictions and additional terms may apply, which are described herein.  If licensing terms herein conflict with Host License, then this Supplemental License shall govern with respect to the Container Image. BY ACCEPTING THIS SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE OR USING THE CONTAINER IMAGE, YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTAINER IMAGE.\r\n\r\n**DEFINITIONS**\u003cbr/\u003e\r\n**Windows Server Container** (without Hyper-V isolation) is a feature of Microsoft Windows Server software. \r\n\r\n**Windows Server Container with Hyper-V isolation.**  Section 2(k) of the Microsoft Windows Server license terms is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the revised terms as shown in “UPDATED” below.\r\n\r\nUPDATED: Windows Server Container with Hyper-V isolation (formerly known as Hyper-V Container) is a container technology in Windows Server which utilizes a virtual operating system environment to host one or more Windows Server Container(s).  Each Hyper-V isolation instance used to host one or more Windows Server Container(s) is considered one virtual operating system environment.\r\n\r\n**LICENSE TERMS**\u003cbr/\u003e\r\n**Host License.** The Host License terms apply to your use of the Container Image and any Windows container(s) created with the Container Image which are distinct and separate from a virtual machine.\r\n\r\n**Use Rights.**  The Container Image may be used to create an isolated virtualized Windows operating system environment that includes at least one application that adds primary and significant functionality. You may use the Container Image only to create, build, and run Windows container(s) on Host Software.  Updates to the Host Software may not update the Container Image so you may re-create any Windows containers based on an updated Container Image.   \r\n\r\n**Restrictions.**  You may not remove this Supplemental License document file from the Container Image.  You may not enable remote access to the application(s) you run within your container to avoid applicable license fees.  You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Container Image, or attempt to do so, except and only to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing the use of certain open-source components that may be included with the software.  Additional restrictions in the Host License may apply.\r\n\r\n**ADDITIONAL TERMS**\u003cbr/\u003e\r\n**Client Host Software.**  When running a Container Image on Client Host Software you may run any number of the Container Image instantiated as Windows containers for test or development purposes only.  You may not use these Windows containers in a production environment on Client Host Software.\r\n\r\n**IoT Host Software.**  When running a Container Image on IoT Host Software you may run any number of the Container Image instantiated as Windows containers for test or development purposes only. You may only use the Container Image in a production environment if you have agreed to the Microsoft Commercial Terms of Use for Windows 10 Core Runtime Images or the Windows 10 IoT Enterprise Device License (“Windows IoT Commercial Agreement”). Additional terms and restrictions in the Windows IoT Commercial Agreements apply to your use of Container Image in a production environment.\r\n\r\n**Third Party Software.** The Container Image may include third party applications that are licensed to you under this Supplemental License or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, for the third-party applications may be accessible online at http://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices or in an accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages in the Host License also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.  \r\n\r\n**Open Source Components.** The Container Image may contain third party copyrighted software licensed under open source licenses with source code availability obligations.
